# sqlite-react

⚠ **This library is in development!** ⚠

A small wrapper [sqlite.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js), providing convenience functions for:

- Lazy instantiation of sqlite worker instance
- Pre-loading an sqlite binary database from a URL
- Promise-based delegation to worker for querying
- Simple execution time profiling for queries
- Simple es6 template string formatter for building SQL
- React hook for query execution, loading state, and results

All with Typescript goodness 👌🏻
